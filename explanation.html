      <h3 class="subTitle" style="float:right;">What is the model minority myth really saying?</h3>

      <div class="IntroPara" style="float:right; float:top;">
        <p>
       The notion of the model minority insinuates that "if asians can do this, there's no racial discrimination, and disparities don't count."
        </p>
<h3 class="subTitle">Mental Health applications</h3>
         <p>
        A profound consequence of the model minority myth is the detriment it imposes on the mental health of Asian Americans. According to many studies including UCLA Health, Asian Americans are less likely to reach out for emotional or mental health problems than white americans, even more so for U.S. born Asian women. It is also important to note that the suicide death rate of young women ages 15-24 is 30% higher in Asians. 

<h3 class="subTitle">Education & Workforce</h3>

        Education wise, Asians living in the states have lower return rate than that of white people, meaning that Asians spend more money on more schooling just to reach the equivalent status as their white counterparts working the same jobs in the same fields.
