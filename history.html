      <div class="IntroPara">

    <h3 class="subTitleleft" >Late 19th century...</h3>
        <p>
        The Yellow Peril(a color metaphor that depicts the peoples of East and Southeast Asia as an existential danger to the Western World) of the 19th century led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese immigration to the U.S. As Asian immigration grew between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, discrimination grew with them. Notable events were the mobs against Filipinos in Northern California and the Japanese internment during WWII, which went on until around the 1960s.
        </p>

<h3 class="subTitle">1950s</h3>
         <p> 
         The model minority stereotype emerged in the United States during the Cold War in the 1950s, and was first explicitly used as a term in the 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement. Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished quotas that had originally made it easier for Europeans to immigrate to the country, but opened doors to those who could contribute most to the country; the law created a preference system that focused on immigrants' skills.
        </p>

<h3 class="subTitleleft" style="text-align: left;">Mid 1960s</h3>
         <p>
       In 1966, The New York Times published a writing titled 'Success Story, Japanese-American Style' by William Petersen, in which he stated, <br>
       "Barely more than 20 years after the end of the war-time camps, this is a minority that has risen above even prejudiced criticism. By any criterion of good citizenship, the Japanese Americans are better than any other group in our society, including native-born whites."<br>
       This eventually grew to be inclusive of all Asians.
        </p>

<h3 class="subTitle">Now</h3>
        <p>
        Up until the present day, this myth has been used essentially as a sort of propaganda to say "We applaud Asian Americans, but really we're denigrating other racial minorities."
