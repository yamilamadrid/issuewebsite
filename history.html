        The Yellow Peril led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 which banned chinese immigration to the U.S. As Asian immigration grew between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, discrimination grew with them. Mobs against Filipinos in Northern California, Japanese internment WWII, went on until about the 1960s

        The model minority stereotype emerged in the United States during the Cold War in the 1950s, and was first explicitly used as a term in the 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement. Immigration act of 1965, allowed certain backgrounds into the states.

        Up until the present day, this myth has been used essentially as a sort of propaganda to say "We applaud Asian Americans, but really we're denigrating other racial minorities."
